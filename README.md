# User Flow Diagram for Simple Application

This repository contains the **User Flow Diagram** for a simple application, detailing the steps users take to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts. The diagram illustrates how users interact with the app, including sign-up, login, password recovery, and email verification processes.

## Flowchart Description

The flowchart visualizes the following steps:

1. **Start Screen**: The entry point of the application.
2. **Sign Up/Log In Decision**: If the user is not signed up, they can choose to sign up. If they have an account, they can log in.
3. **Sign Up Process**: The user enters their details (e.g., username, email, password), submits the form, and their account is created.
4. **Log In Process**: The user enters their credentials and gains access to the home screen.
5. **Forgot Password**: Users who have forgotten their password can request a password reset via email.
6. **Email Verification**: After signing up or changing the password, an email verification step ensures security.
